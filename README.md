# The Problem: 

With rising urbanisation and increasing demand of real estate, deforestation has been rampant and the number of trees are reducing at an alarming rate. As a result, climate has been hit hard, especially in areas with dense population. The consequences of this decrease in trees have been high CO2 Emissions causing an increase in Global Warming.

# Proposed Solution:

To counter the problem of decrease in the number of trees due to an imbalance of cutting and planting of trees, Aranyani proposes the following plan:
- An app that can connect planters and donators
- If anyone wants to make a donation, they can cover the cost of planting a tree and list their preferences of area
- The donation is processed to a verified volunteer who will plant a tree in the required area
- After proper verification of the process, e- certification as a token of appreciation is given to both the volunteer and donators.

Additionally, our app would also connect one to the nearest wood storage facility in case of need of wood. This feature would inform anyone in need of wood with the nearest wood storage facility, it's availability, and the contact details for the same. This would be a huge step forward and would avoid a lot of unnecessary cutting of trees.
